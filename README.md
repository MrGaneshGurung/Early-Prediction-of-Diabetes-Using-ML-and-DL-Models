Diabetes is a major global health issue affecting more than 422 million people. If not diagnosed early, it can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, nerve damage and vision loss. Early detection is therefore vital. This dissertation explores how machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models can be used to predict diabetes from patient data. The study uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains common problems such as missing values, implausible zero entries, and an imbalance between diabetic and non-diabetic cases. To address these, the data was cleaned using median imputation, scaled for consistency, and balanced with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).

Five models were trained and compared: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Neural Network. Their performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. Interpretability was added through LIME, which explained the most important features in predictions. XGBoost achieved the best results, with an accuracy of 76.6% and an F1-score of 0.70. LIME confirmed that glucose, BMI and insulin were the strongest predictors. The project shows that machine learning can support early diabetes detection, though larger datasets are needed for real-world use.
